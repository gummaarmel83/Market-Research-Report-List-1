<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rodless Cylinders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Acting Cylinders</li><li>Double-Acting Cylinders</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rodless cylinders are compact linear actuators used in various applications, and they come in two primary types: single-acting and double-acting cylinders. Single-acting cylinders utilize air pressure for movement in one direction, relying on a spring return for retraction, making them simple and cost-effective. Conversely, double-acting cylinders use air pressure for both extending and retracting the piston, providing greater force and control. Both types are favored in industries where space constraints and reliability are crucial.</p></p>
