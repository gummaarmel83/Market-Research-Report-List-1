<p><strong>The Intrauterine Contraceptive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nonhormonal Intrauterine Contraceptive Devices</li><li>Hormonal Intrauterine Contraceptive Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intrauterine contraceptive market comprises two primary types: nonhormonal and hormonal intrauterine devices (IUDs). Nonhormonal IUDs, often made of copper, prevent fertilization by creating a hostile environment for sperm and eggs. In contrast, hormonal IUDs release hormones, such as progestin, which thicken cervical mucus and inhibit ovulation, enhancing pregnancy prevention. Both types offer long-term contraception, but they differ in mechanisms, side effects, and suitability for various user preferences, contributing to diverse options in family planning.</p></p>
